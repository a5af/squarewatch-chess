# MASTER GUIDE REFERENCE

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You are in a SUBMODULE, not the parent repository.**

---

## üö® STOP: Read Parent Repository's Master Guide

This repository (`squarewatch-chess`) is a **Git submodule** of the parent `WebProjects` workspace.

**The comprehensive agent guide you need is located in the PARENT repository:**

```
../_docs/MASTER_GUIDE_AGENT_ESSENTIALS.md
```

**Full absolute path (example for Agent5):**
```
D:\Code\WebProjects5\_docs\MASTER_GUIDE_AGENT_ESSENTIALS.md
```

---

## Why This Matters

When you're working inside a submodule directory, you may forget you're in a nested repository context. The parent repository contains:

‚úÖ **Complete agent startup procedures**
‚úÖ **Security requirements and rules**
‚úÖ **Engineering principles**
‚úÖ **GitHub workflow and PR requirements**
‚úÖ **Workspace structure and navigation**
‚úÖ **Troubleshooting guides**

**This submodule is part of the larger WebProjects workspace ecosystem.**

---

## Navigation

### To Read the Master Guide

```bash
# From this submodule directory (squarewatch-chess):
cd ..
cat _docs/MASTER_GUIDE_AGENT_ESSENTIALS.md

# Or use your editor/viewer:
code ../_docs/MASTER_GUIDE_AGENT_ESSENTIALS.md
```

### To Return to Parent Workspace Root

```bash
cd ..
pwd  # Should show: .../WebProjectsN (where N matches your agent)
```

---

## Quick Context Check

**Are you in a submodule?**
```bash
git rev-parse --show-superproject-working-tree
```
- If output shows a path ‚Üí You're in a submodule
- If empty ‚Üí You're in the parent workspace root

**Which repository are you in?**
```bash
pwd
basename $(pwd)
```
- `squarewatch-chess` ‚Üí You're in this submodule
- `WebProjects` or `WebProjectsN` ‚Üí You're in parent workspace

## What This File Is NOT

‚ùå This is NOT a replacement for the master guide
‚ùå This is NOT comprehensive documentation
‚ùå This is NOT project-specific instructions

**This is simply a pointer** to help you navigate back to the parent repository's comprehensive guide.

---

## Project-Specific Documentation

For `squarewatch-chess`-specific documentation (architecture, setup, API docs), see:
- `README.md` (this repository)
- `docs/` directory (if exists)
- Project-specific guides in this repo

For **agent workflow, security rules, and startup procedures**, always refer to:
- `../_docs/MASTER_GUIDE_AGENT_ESSENTIALS.md` (parent repository)

---

**Remember:** When working across submodules, always maintain awareness of your current repository context.
